# Java Practice

 A collection of Java exercises and coding challenges completed during my learning journey â€” from beginner topics to object-oriented programming and beyond.

## Topics Covered

- Variables, operators, and control flow
- Arrays and strings
- OOP: classes, constructors, getters/setters
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Method overloading and overriding
- Exception handling
- Working with collections and streams (coming soon)
- File I/O and data processing

##  Goals

- Practice daily to build muscle memory ðŸ§ 
- Solidify core Java concepts for job readiness
- Track my own progress over time

## Structure

Each file or package represents a separate topic or task from:

- Online Java courses (e.g., Stepik)
- Custom mini-projects
- Self-made exercises based on real-world logic

## Note

This is a **learning project**, not a production app. Iâ€™m growing my skills step by step â€” and I document my progress here.
